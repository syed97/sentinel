## 1. What You Need Before Starting

Install these on your computer before anything else.

| Tool | Purpose | Download |
|------|---------|----------|
| Git | Version control | https://git-scm.com |
| Docker Desktop | Run the app locally | https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop |
| Python 3.11+ | Run seed and utility scripts | https://www.python.org |
| A GitHub account | Host the code | https://github.com |
| A Railway account | Free cloud hosting | https://railway.app (sign in with GitHub) |

---

## 2. Local Development Setup

Follow these steps exactly, in order.

### Step 1 — Get the code onto your computer

Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/sentinel.git
cd sentinel
```

Replace `YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### Step 2 — Generate VAPID keys for push notifications

These keys let the app send push notifications to your phone. Run this once.

```bash
cd backend
pip install pywebpush
python scripts/generate_vapid.py
```

You will see output like this:

```
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
MHQCAQEEIAbc...
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----

VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=BHk3Xyz...
```

**Copy both values and keep them somewhere safe.** You will need them in Steps 3 and later when deploying to Railway.

### Step 3 — Create your environment file

```bash
# Still inside the backend folder
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` in any text editor and fill in:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://sentinel:sentinel_dev@localhost:5432/sentinel
SECRET_KEY=    ← paste a random string here (see tip below)
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=    ← paste from Step 2
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=     ← paste from Step 2
VAPID_EMAIL=your-real-email@domain.com
ENVIRONMENT=development
```

**Tip — generate a SECRET_KEY:**
```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

### Step 4 — Start the database and backend

Go back to the root sentinel folder:

```bash
cd ..   # back to sentinel/
docker-compose up --build
```

Docker will download what it needs (takes a few minutes the first time) and start:
- PostgreSQL database on port 5432
- FastAPI backend on port 8000

When you see `Application startup complete` in the terminal, the backend is running.

**Test it:** Open http://localhost:8000/health in your browser. You should see:
```json
{"status": "ok", "app": "Sentinel"}
```

### Step 5 — Run the database migration

Open a **new terminal window** (keep Docker running in the first one):

```bash
cd sentinel/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://sentinel:sentinel_dev@localhost:5432/sentinel alembic upgrade head
```

This creates all the database tables. You should see:
```
INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade  -> 0001_initial
```

### Step 6 — Seed the database

```bash
# Still in sentinel/backend
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://sentinel:sentinel_dev@localhost:5432/sentinel python seed.py
```

The script will ask for your name, email, and a password. This creates:
- Your pilot team with all 24 jurisdictions
- 13 pre-configured RSS news sources
- 3 default message templates
- Your first admin account

## 3. Deploy to Railway

Do this after local setup is working.

### Step 1 — Push code to GitHub

```bash
# In the sentinel root folder
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Sentinel scaffold"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sentinel.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2 — Create a Railway project

1. Go to https://railway.app and sign in
2. Click **New Project**
3. Choose **Deploy from GitHub repo**
4. Select your `sentinel` repository
5. Railway will detect the `railway.toml` and start building

### Step 3 — Add a PostgreSQL database

1. In your Railway project, click **+ New**
2. Choose **Database → Add PostgreSQL**
3. Railway automatically sets `DATABASE_URL` for you — no action needed

### Step 4 — Set environment variables in Railway

1. Click your backend service in Railway
2. Go to the **Variables** tab
3. Add these variables one by one:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | A random 64-character string (generate with python tip above) |
| `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` | From Step 2 of local setup |
| `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` | From Step 2 of local setup |
| `VAPID_EMAIL` | Your email address |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | `production` |

`DATABASE_URL` is already set by Railway — do not add it manually.

### Step 5 — Run the migration on Railway

1. In Railway, click your backend service
2. Go to the **Shell** tab
3. Run:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Step 6 — Seed the Railway database

In the same Railway Shell:

```bash
python seed.py
```

Enter your name, email, and password when prompted.

### Step 7 — Get your public URL

1. Click your backend service in Railway
2. Go to **Settings → Networking**
3. Click **Generate Domain**
4. Your app is live at `https://something.up.railway.app`

---

## 4. First Run — Seed the Database

The seed script only needs to run once per environment (local or Railway). If you run it twice, it will create a second team. If that happens, contact your engineer.

---

## 5. Install the App on Your Phone

### iPhone
1. Open Safari and go to your Railway URL
2. Tap the **Share** button (box with arrow pointing up)
3. Scroll down and tap **Add to Home Screen**
4. Tap **Add**
5. Open the app from your home screen
6. Go to **Settings** and tap **Enable Push Notifications**
7. Tap **Allow** when your phone asks for permission

### Android
1. Open Chrome and go to your Railway URL
2. Tap the **three dots menu** (top right)
3. Tap **Add to Home Screen**
4. Tap **Add**
5. Open the app and enable notifications in Settings

**Note:** Push notifications on iPhone require iOS 16.4 or later.

## 6. Adding Keywords

Keywords let Sentinel flag news articles that mention specific schools, landmarks, or locations in your coverage area.

1. Log in to the dashboard
2. Go to **Configuration → Keywords**
3. Click **Add Keyword**
4. Type the keyword (e.g. `Lincoln High School` or `Route 9 bridge`)
5. Click **Save**

Keywords are case-insensitive and match anywhere in an article's title or summary.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

**Docker won't start**
Make sure Docker Desktop is open and running before running `docker-compose up`.

**"MODULE NOT FOUND" error when running seed.py**
Make sure you're in the `sentinel/backend` folder when running the seed script, not the root folder.

**Migration fails with "already exists" error**
The migration has already run. This is fine — run `alembic current` to check the status.

**Push notifications not arriving on iPhone**
Check that your iOS version is 16.4 or later. Go to Settings → General → Software Update.

**The app says "No events" on the dashboard**
The NWS worker runs every 5 minutes. Wait a few minutes after startup and refresh. If your coverage area has no active weather alerts, the Active section will be empty — that's correct behavior.

**Need to add a second team member?**
Go to **Configuration → Team Members → Invite**. They will receive a setup email.
